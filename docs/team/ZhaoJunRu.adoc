== PROJECT: VolunCHeer V1.3

---

== Overview

VolunCheer is a desktop application for project managers who wish to keep track of their ongoing / upcoming projects as well as their beneficiary and volunteer pool.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: implemented *addProject command whereby it adds a new Project to the VolunCHeer application*
** What it does: allows the user to add in a new project with attributes "Project Title" and "Project Date" to keep track of current projects on hand.
** Justification: This forms the basis of the VolunCHeer application whereby the aim is to manage and organise projects better and save users form the hustle of paper works.
** Highlights: This enhancement was built on the existing add command with some variation in the attributes presented. The implementation was relatively easy but relevant features pertaining to the specific projects requires more in-depth knowledge and analysis of design alternatives. The User Interface is adjusted accordingly as well to show
    execution of commands and the relevant result.
** Relevant features/enhancements:
    1. Assign Beneficiary *allows the user to assign a existing beneficiary to the project selected*
       - Justification: A beneficiary is usually attached to a project and beneficiary details are very important and usually tracked in a separate document / file. Thus we decide to keep Beneficiary information as a separate list and assigned to the project when required such that it can be managed separately.
       - Highlights: This enhancement requires data from both the project list as well as the beneficiary list, there was thus some difficulty trying to implement the command. Many adjustments had to be made to keep the project class and beneficiary class independent.
    2. Complete project *allows the user to mark a project as completed in the project list* this is indicated by a colour change - to red for the project title.
       - Justification: This is thought to be a useful feature as project managers would want to keep track of what are the ongoing projects while still have a copy of their completed projects.
       - Highlights: This enhancement indicates a change of status of the specified project, it is a simple yet useful feature for the user.

* *Minor enhancement*: Edit project and Delete project commands are inherited from addressbook and successfully implemented on the project class.
